he Moonwell Card is more than just a payment tool—it’s a gateway to financial freedom. By integrating with Moonwell’s lending and borrowing protocol, users can earn interest on supplied assets (like cbBTC or USDC in the Flagship USDC Vault) while spending borrowed funds in the real world. The upcoming Auto Load feature will further streamline the experience, ensuring your card is always funded without interrupting your yield-earning assets.

For example, imagine supplying cbBTC as collateral on Moonwell to borrow USDC, which you load onto your card. You can then tap your phone at a café using Apple Pay, shop online internationally, or pay a bill—all while your cbBTC continues to earn interest onchain. This seamless blend of DeFi and real-world utility sets the Moonwell Card apart.
