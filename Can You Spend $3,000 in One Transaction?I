If you load your Moonwell Card with 3,000 USDC, you can generally use it to pay for a $3,000 product in a single transaction, provided the following conditions are met:Merchant Acceptance: The merchant must accept VISA payments for the full amount. Most VISA-accepting merchants support large transactions, but some may have their own limits.

Available Funds: The 3,000 USDC must be fully loaded and available on your card. Ensure there are no restrictions, such as holds or pending transactions, that reduce your balance.

Transaction Limits: While no specific per-transaction limit is mentioned in the available information, some crypto debit cards may have daily or single-transaction caps imposed by the issuer (Cypher) or the merchant. Check the Cypher Moonwell Card Dashboard or contact support to confirm if any such limits apply.

Currency Settings: Some vendors (e.g., Amazon) may default to HKD due to the issuing bank (Reap) being based in Hong Kong. You can manually adjust the currency to USD during checkout to avoid conversion issues.

To ensure a smooth $3,000 transaction, verify your card balance in the Cypher Moonwell Card Dashboard and confirm with the merchant that they accept a single VISA payment of that amount. If you plan to borrow USDC against supplied assets, ensure your collateral (e.g., cbBTC or ETH) supports the loan
