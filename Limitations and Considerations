USDC Focus: Currently, the Moonwell app only supports loading with USDC, though the Cypher Moonwell Card Dashboard allows loading with other tokens on Base.

No Cashback: The card doesn’t offer direct cashback, but you can earn WELL and MORPHO rewards by depositing USDC in Moonwell’s Flagship USDC Vault.

Non-Reversible Loads: Funds loaded onto the card cannot be transferred back to your wallet as crypto. To convert back to crypto, you’d need to use the card to purchase crypto directly.

Regional Restrictions: The card is available to users outside sanctioned countries, but some features (like certain payment methods) may vary by region
