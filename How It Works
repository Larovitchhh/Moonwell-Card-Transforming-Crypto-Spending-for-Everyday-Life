The Moonwell Card simplifies the complex process of converting crypto to real-world spending. When you load your card with USDC, the funds are sent to Cypher, where they are redeemed for USD through their Circle Mint account and routed to Cypherâ€™s partner bank, Reap. This infrastructure ensures instant fiat transactions both in-store and online, delivering a smooth and reliable payment experience.
